Mom and Dad told us to stay away from it.\"\n\nBut Tom did not listen to Sam. He was curious and naughty. He opened the bottle and smelled it. It smelled bad, like rotten eggs. He said, \"I wonder how it tastes. Maybe it is not so bad.\" He put the bottle to his mouth and drank a little bit.\n\nSam saw Tom drink the poison and screamed, \"Tom, no! You are silly! You drank poison! You need help!\" He ran to the house and called Mom and Dad. They came quickly and saw Tom lying on the ground. He was pale and sweating. He was not moving. He looked scary.\n\nMom and Dad were very worried and angry. They called the doctor and took Tom to the hospital. The doctor gave Tom some medicine and made him throw up the poison. He said, \"Tom is lucky. He did not drink too much poison. He will be okay, but he needs to rest and drink a lot of water. He should never do that again. Poison is dangerous and can kill you.\"\n\nTom learned his lesson. He was sorry for what he did. He said, \"I am sorry, Sam. I am sorry, Mom and Dad. I was stupid and foolish. I will never touch poison again. I will listen to you and be good.\" Sam hugged Tom and said, \"I am glad you are okay, Tom. I love you, brother. You are not stupid, but you need to be careful and smart. Poison is not a toy. It is scary and bad.\" Mom and Dad hugged them both and said, \"We love you, Tom and Sam. We are happy you are safe.

It is so nice and warm.\"\n\nTom likes a truck. It is red and shiny. It has four wheels and a horn. He pushes it on the floor and makes a loud noise. He says, \"Mom, can we buy this truck? It is so fast and fun.\"\n\nMom looks at the toys and smiles. She says, \"They are both very nice toys, but we can only buy one. We have to look at the price. The price tells us how much money we have to give to the shopkeeper.\"\n\nShe shows them the tags on the toys. The bear has a tag that says \"5\". The truck has a tag that says \"10\". She says, \"The truck is more expensive than the bear. It costs twice as much. We have to choose the toy that costs less.\"\n\nLily and Tom think for a moment. They both want to make their baby brother happy. They decide to buy the bear. They say, \"Sorry, truck. Maybe next time. We will buy the bear. It is cheaper and softer.\"\n\nMom pays the shopkeeper and gives him the money. He says, \"Thank you for buying the bear. It is a very old bear. It has been in the shop for a long time. No one wanted it. You are very kind to give it a new home.\"\n\nLily and Tom are happy. They carry the bear to the car. They say, \"We can't wait to give the bear to our baby brother. He will love it. It is a very special bear.\"", "source": "tinystories_replay"}

Lily was very happy and started drawing right away.\n\nAs she drew, Lily noticed that one of her markers was running out of ink. She tried to use it, but it didn't make a good mark anymore. She felt upset because she really liked that marker. \n\nBut then, Lily had an idea. She decided to use that marker to number all the pages of her drawing book. She started at number one and went all the way up to number ten. Now, she could keep track of all her drawings and know which one came first and which one came last. Lily was very proud of herself and happy that she found a way to use her marker even though it was running out of ink.", "source": "tinystories_replay"}
